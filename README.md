## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

# Car Racing Game in Java

## Overview

This project is a **car racing game** developed in Java.  
It supports different game modes: 

1. **Solo** – endless race for a single player  
2. **Two human players** – two players on the same computer  
3. **One player vs AI** – a human player competes against a computer-controlled car  

The game is built using **object-oriented programming**, with an abstract `Car` class and specialized classes for players and AI.
